## update 2/3/2016

The data manipulation should be pretty much finalized.  We have the 1km and 5km distance bands integrated into the analysis, we are waiting on the 10km distance bands.  Next steps:

* get the 10km distance bands and integrate rolling total injection for 3, 6, 12, and 24 months at each monitoring well based on the 10km distance bands,
* figure out the TRI data: we want to include a control in our models for the number of TRI reporting facilities within certain distances of each water quality monitoring station.
* we are also waiting on the land-use variables and population density variable.  When these are ready we need to match land-use and population density to each monitoring well and include these variables as additional controls in our models.
